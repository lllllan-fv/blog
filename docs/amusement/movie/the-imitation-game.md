## 你知道人为什么喜欢暴力吗？因为暴力让他们感觉很好

> Do you know why people like violence? It is because it feels good.

## 有时候正是那些意料之外的人，做出了人们意想不到的事

> Sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of, who do the things no one can image.

## 人们交谈的时候，从来不说自己的真实意图、而是旁敲侧击，却期望你能明白他们的意思。可我从来都不懂

> When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean, they say something else. And you're expected to just know what they mean. Only I never do.

## 可惜即便这样，我也没有机会继续进修

> - You earned a double first in mathematics.
> - But sadly, wasn't granted the opportunity to become a fellow.

## 今天早上，我坐火车穿过了一座城市，它之所以还存在，都是因为你；卖给我车票的那个人，他之所以能活到现在，很大概率也是因为你；我工作研究的内容，整个科学探索领域，它之所以存在，也都是因为你

> Do you know, this morning, I was on a train went through a city that wouldn't exist if it wasn't for you. I bought a ticket from a man who would likely be dead if it wasn't for you. I read up on my work, a whole field of scientific inquiry that only exists because of you.

## 如果你希望自己是个正常人，我可以向你保证，我不这么希望。这个世界能变成今天这么美好，正是由于你不同于常人

> Now, if you wish you could have been normal, I can promise you, I do not. The world is an infinitely better place precisely because you weren't.
